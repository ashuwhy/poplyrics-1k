(Lonely)\nAre you leaving a mark, or scared to make a bad impression so you just go hide in the dark? (Lonely)\nLivin' and playin' a part, knowin' regret'll come back up tomorrow\nThat's what it does, ain't it? Don't know what we're chasin', but we all do it\nJust a part of life, I guess we're all foolish\nRunning after what we think will make us happy 'til it falls through (Lonely)\nAnd then we find out later it ain't what we wanted\nSo we give up on it, then we pile the garbage (Lonely)\nAnd we watch it grow and find a drug to numb it\n'Til we hit the point that we can barely function\nAm I motivated?

(To see you)\nTo meet you? (To meet you, ooh-ooh-ooh)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook & j-hope, Jung Kook]\nPass the end of winter's cold\nUntil the spring day comes again\nUntil the flowers bloom again\nPlease stay, please stay there a little longer\n\n[Verse 2: Suga, Jimin]\nIs it you who changed? (Is it you who changed)\nOr is it me? (Or is it me)\nI hate this moment, this time flowing by\nWe've changed, you know?\nJust like everyone, you know?\nYes, I hate you, you left me\nBut I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day\nI miss you, honestly, but I'll erase you\n'Cause it hurts less than to blame you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]\nI try to exhale you in pain\nLike smoke, like white smoke\nI say that I'll erase you\nBut I can't really let you go yet\n\n[Chorus: Jung Kook & j-hope, Jung Kook, V & j-hope]\nSnowflakes fall down\nAnd fall apart little by little\nI miss you (I miss you)\nI miss you (I miss you)\nHow long do I have to wait\nAnd how many nights do I have to pass\nTo see you? (To see you)\nTo meet you? (To meet you, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)\n\n[Bridge: V, Jung Kook, Jimin]\nYou know it all, you're my best friend\nThe morning will come again\nNo darkness, no season can last forever\n\n[Chorus: Jimin & j-hope, Jung Kook, Jung Kook & j-hope, \"V & Jimin\"]\nMaybe cherries are blossoming\nAnd winter is going to be over\nI miss you (I miss you, ah)\nI miss you (I miss you, ah-ah-ah)\nWait a little bit, just a few more nights\nI'll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)\nI'll come for you \"I'll come for you, yeah, eh-eh, yeah, yeah\"\n\n[Post-Chorus: Jin & j-hope, Jin]\nPass the end of winter's cold\nUntil the spring day comes again\nUntil the flowers bloom again\nPlease stay, please stay there a little longer",
