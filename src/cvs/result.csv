I miss the days when life was so simple
Felt like the glass was always half-full
Where did that go?
And every second with you was so special
Back when we didn't fear the unknowns
But that was long ago

Who can say where the path will go?
Philosophers guess, but they just don't know
Maybe that's why

[Chorus]
We had our heads in the clouds
Thought we had it all figured out
Planning to fly away
To escape everything on the ground
But like a plane up in space
We slowly drifted away
And every plan that we made
And dream that we chased
Are just memories now
They're just memories now

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure where everything went wrong
But I know that we landed where we both belong
I just wish we weren't scared to say
That there's expiration dates on the friends you make
As hard as that may sound
Who can say where the path will go?
Philosophers guess but they just don't know
Maybe that's why

We had our heads in the clouds

Or were we too afraid to have no one around?

In my hotel room alone, this red wine's hitting different now
I'm so low, so low
My heart is aching and my brain is breaking, don't understand
How you said you loved me, then you ended up with another man
I lay my feelings out, hard to believe that you ever cared
Now I'm so low, so low
(Yeah)

[Chorus]
It's nights like this when I'm too fucked up
Was tryna escape but it just didn't work
I only end up missing you more
Laying face down on the bathroom floor
'Cause it's nights like this when I miss your touch
Nights like this when I just feel numb
It's nights like this I'd spend with someone
Disappointed 'cause it's just not us

[Verse 2]
Too many nights on my own
Who's gonna be your replacement so your side of the bed isn't cold?
I still can't believe you took off from me when you knew I needed you most
How I spilled my heart when I watched you leave
I think some of me died
I can't get peace of mind
'Cause I still think about it all the time
Well, it's nights like this when I'm too fucked up
Was tryna escape but it just didn't work
I only end up missing you more
Laying face down on the bathroom floor
'Cause it's nights like this when I miss your touch
Nights like this when I just feel numb
It's nights like this I'd spend with someone

How did your heart mend so easy?
Mine still bleeds (Ooh-ooh)
Hard to believe you don't need me
All those memories we made are burnin' in my brain
And I'm stuck in yesterday, for me, it's still the same
Tell me how (Ooh-ooh)

The ghost of you still floats around my room
It lets me know that letting go's just not the same with you
Now every night I lay here in this bed we made for two
But I'm sleepin' alone while you're out therе with somebody in theirs

In the way that I did, you abandoned me here

Come back and heal me before I'm left scarred
You tell me, ""We took this too far""
As soon as I let down my guard

When you needed it most, as you cried, I was soaked
Now it's weeks since we spoke, had your mom drop my clothes
And she tried to console me that love comes and goes

Baby, come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
Baby, come back

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
It's been a crazy last year, I'm tryna process still
I don't even know how I should feel
I got a couple big houses and some whips, maybe three
And I got family members that got bigger egos than me
And I got fans around the world whenever I'm overseas
And I got friends who just pretend and say they love everything
And yes, I fell in love again, I thought that shit was impossible
And I promise it's too real for me to care what they think
I promise I don't give a fuck because I know who I am
Hatin' on me undercover, I just won't understand
Say we're brothers, call me family, but you act like a fan
2 a.m. in Atlanta, screamin', ""Baby, I'm back"" (Oh, I am)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Play me like a fool, I see
But it's been so long since I thought about you
I swear, okay, baby, I'm back
I guess you weren't the one for me
But it's been so long since I thought about you (I thought about you)
I swear, okay, baby, I'm back
You can gon' and get used to my voice 'cause, baby, I'm back
Young GunWunna, the people's choice, just accept the facts
We bump and grind 'cause shawty mine and she feel attached
I like it, I hope we don't have a fatal attraction
Keep the camera holdin' still, I'm back in that action
Every day, I wake up dressed to kill and that ain't no cappin'
I'm addin' an addition to my fleet, I'm goin' new Brabus
When I perform, it's just a beat, it's giving ""I'm talented""
Ask about me, I'm elite, Wunna ain't average
I'm juggin' and crossin' the street, keepin' my balance
Told myself, ""Stay focused"" when I'm facin' these challenges
Show 'em it ain't over and baby, I'm back again

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
(Oh, I am)
Play me like a fool, I see
But it's been so long since I thought about you
I swear, okay, baby, I'm back
I guess you weren't the one for me
But it's been so long since I thought about you (I thought about you)
I swear, okay, baby, I'm back

[Verse 3: The Kid LAROI]
I told my baby, ""Let them talk,"" that's the caption
I don't even really like bein' online, that shit taxin'
Started off as an attraction
Now it's turnin' to attachment
Overseas, we relaxin', I ain't thinkin' 'bout the past tense (No)
'Cause everybody wanna say shit
All of a sudden, y'all believed in me
All of a sudden, you want a favor now
All of a sudden, you wan' be with me
All of a sudden, y'all always knew
But I remember you ain't see it in me
And yes, I know I'm blessed, but sometimes I wish I could go back

To the way it used to be
Just so I can feel what I been missin' (Oh, baby come back)
You could have it all, you see
But there's just something that's not the same about you (Oh, baby, come back)

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home

To carry love, to carry children of our own

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Castle on the Hill,÷ (Deluxe),3/3/17,4:21,79,Ed Sheeran,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real

Galway Girl,÷ (Deluxe),3/3/17,2:50,76,Ed Sheeran,Ed Sheeran,"[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month

And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

February, and the flowers haven't even wilted

Mid-November, and I'm sippin' on a half-cold coffee

On your arm, a carbon copy

Your eyes were red, and your lips were torn

And pulled me into your desperate breath
The way you kissed me hot and fast

I swore lips were made for lies
And I thought if you'd ever leave me
That I'd be the reason why
And I don't even care if it's just a summer fling
If it's all experimental
And you go back to safer things
But I swore hands were made for fighting
I swore eyes were made to cry
But you're the first person that I've seen

Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)

And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one

We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between

I shaved my head four times because I wanted to
And then I did it one more time 'cause I got sick (I am so lucky)
And I thought I changed so much, nobody would notice it, and no one did
Then I left the doctor's office full of tears
Became a single mom at my premiere
And I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year
And that's the biggest lie of my career

But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die

Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you

Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's somethin' like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need

I can't be the only one who’s lonely tonight
I can't be the only—

[Verse 1: NF]
Yeah, does anybody feel like me?
Show of hands, I don't need a lot, I just wanna find my peace
Yeah, why you throwin’ rocks, oh, you wanna kill my dreams?
Okay, tell me everything I'm not
You think I didn't know those things?
Always been a little lost and I still might be
Life's hard, but it's okay (It's okay)
Watchin' the comments feels like I'm at a court date
How could I complain
With a house like this and a car like that in the driveway?
Half of what I say
Kinda feels like a dream that I’m gonna wake from someday
Wishin’ that I'd pray
A little more often and put more time into my faith
Travel in my brain, woo, might find damage and no grace
Things that I hold on to, but I won’t say things that I won't let go
So I chain my soul to the heartbreak
Havin' a nice day, that's not a average in my case
Don’t like cameras in my face; glamour, it's all fake
Love my job, but it might seem odd that I'm here 'cause I hate fame (Oh)
Yeah, pain might get to me, throwin' threats at me
They can't tell, disconnectin' me, it's affectin' me
Hide that well, they'll write checks to me, but don't check on me
Find myself, always questioning what comes next for me
I can't be the only—
No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only—

[Verse 2: NF & Sasha Alex Sloan]
Yeah, if you made a list of people that you trusted, would you put your name down?
Do you know who you are?
When you look at life and you talk about yours, do you feel proud? (Lonely)
Are you leaving a mark, or scared to make a bad impression so you just go hide in the dark? (Lonely)
Livin' and playin' a part, knowin' regret'll come back up tomorrow
That's what it does, ain't it? Don't know what we're chasin', but we all do it
Just a part of life, I guess we're all foolish
Running after what we think will make us happy 'til it falls through (Lonely)
And then we find out later it ain't what we wanted
So we give up on it, then we pile the garbage (Lonely)
And we watch it grow and find a drug to numb it
'Til we hit the point that we can barely function
Am I motivated? Is my music dated?
Would I be the same if I was medicated?
Even therapists say I need medication
I avoid it, though, because I'm scared to take it
Am I the only one that has a loaded gun
That's full of doubts and memories to overcome?
And I complain about 'em when they shoot at me
But I know truthfully I like to load 'em up and let 'em—
That's so sad to see, that's so sad to see, I need help
They talk passively, then come after me by myself
Lost that half of me, God, there has to be someone else
Don't feel bad for me, I just can't believe that I'm the only

No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only—

There's gotta be somebody somewhere

Lookin' back to when we started (Started)
You're the finest in the mornin', ah
King and a Queen when we're walkin' through
Hold my hand, lemme walk with you
When I look around, you're all I see
Trust me, it was never hard to choose
Golden hour, you're so-so fine
Fine in the mornin' and the evenin' too

I couldn't care if the world was finished
As long as her and I sublime and safe
I was dreaming with the music loud
Hundred miles on the PCH
You was with me with the windows down
I knew everything would be okay
Oh, I knew everything would work out (Work out)

Even when things got bad, you stuck around and always held me high
You don't gotta tell me, you show me everyday that you're mine
I know what we have is so special and that's the reason why
You got me stupid, matter fact, I don't know what I'm doing
I used to say ""Ain't never gon' love nobody 'til I met you"" it's confusin'
You changed everything, you changed how I think
Used to say ""Ain't never gon' love nobody 'til I met you"" it's confusin'

I came from nothin' and now I'm upside
Always give thanks to the ones around me
Including all of my haters too
But it don't compare to the love from family
I know they're seein' my every move
So, I've gotta make sure I'm doin' it right
I-- I-- I don't wanna see them leave my side
But I guess it's part of the circle of life
Times are changin' as I been growing
I'm seein' my life from a different lens
I don't wanna be someone who's forgotten
So I been rappin' in future tense
I don't wanna be great, I'm gonna be great
My fam' now sayin' they understand
Life gets lonely, I need me a lover
I'll fly her away like Peter Pan
Step outside, beautiful day
Perfect time, she wanna tan
This one here, I think she a keeper
A and B, she both my plans
I like her hair, she keep it simple
I'm feelin' different around her (Around her)
I find that time to make her mine
Call it the golden hour

[Verse 5: Lil Man J]
(Ayy) Yeah, uh
Don't have a good past with falling in love
But there's something about you I can't get enough
Is it your heart? Is it your hair? I'mma just list it as ""All the above""
You just my type, stole my heart like a thief in the night
How are you so great and I'm alright?
Helped me leave a dark place when you shined your light
Where have you been all my life?
You hold yourself like you don't even need a man
Don't do this love-thing but you made me feel I can
Helped me to realize that I can do better and
Made me a man I thought I never would've been
(Yeah, that's facts)
Compared to the rest, oh, yeah, you are much greater than
Falling in love, no, it wasn't part of the plan
But the feelings for you that I have, you don't understand
Oh, girl, I love how you make everything okay
Walk through life, letting nothing get in your way
June 18th, on that waterfront terrace
I said you'll always remind me of these sunsets in paris
The way you

Yeah, I love the way you're shinin' (Shinin', shinin', ayy)

Ich laufe Straßen auf und ab
Ich weiß nicht, ob ich dich noch finden kann
Ich such' dich nicht mehr, denn ich suchte

Oh, bleib doch wo du willst, lass dann meine Wohnung still
Doch ich weiß, die Türen werden wieder knall'n

Ich will nur, dass du weinst, wenn ich wein', wenn ich wein', wenn ich wein'
Dass du fällst, wenn ich fall', wenn ich fall', wenn ich fall'
Oh, sei verliebt

[Strophe 2: Ali Gatie, AYLIVA & Ali Gatie]
I shoulda never ever let you in
I shoulda known you were trouble from the start
Everybody else saw it
I guess that love keeps you blinded in the dark
You were never the one for me (Never the one for me)
You just needed some company (You just needed some company)

And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard

Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

Be us against the world

Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah

Outside, it starts to pour

Over-solid, keep it concrete

Take a turn and tell you what it be
Backshots make you feel relief

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny

That looks tasty, that looks plenty

Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burnin' heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love, I could barely eat
There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be

Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me

And she put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamplight, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

And I'm not how you hoped

If the sun don't shine

Forgive my northern attitude

Would That I,"Wasteland, Baby!",3/1/19,4:28,69,Hozier,Hozier,"[Verse 1]
True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
A willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicoes
Over canopy dapple long ago

[Verse 2]
True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire, but that was long ago

[Chorus]
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
Light a fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose, I was never the same
Watching still-living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago

[Chorus]
That's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)

Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

[Verse 5]
So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the ""would that I'd loved"" is long ago

And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)

The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do

She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is ""Stella by Starlight""

Tell me who and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek
As soft as Chet can sing ""Let's Get Lost""?
And let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper, doll
Blow sweet and thick till every thought of it don't mean a thing
I got some colour back, she thinks so too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, ""Is everything alright?""
And, Lord

About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?

I will not ask and neither should you

Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping

Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing

Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though
I'm lying down
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh, no, no, no

How you feel? (How you feel?)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar

Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times

I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body's achin'

Can't take what's been given (No way)

If We Have Each Other,Narrated For You,11/16/18,3:01,75,Alec Benjamin,Alec Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
She was 19 with a baby on the way
On the EastSide of the city, she was working every day
Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake
She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change
And 'cross town she would take the bus at night
To a one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light
She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright
She was waiting on the day she hoped her baby would arrive

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd never be alone
Have someone to hold
And when nights were cold
She'd say

The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad
If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect, when the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
They were 90 and were living out their days
On the Westside of the city, next to where they got engaged
They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made
And though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed
With each other, and though some times were hard
Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart
No, they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car
But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart
Even at the end
Their love was stronger than
The day that they first met
They'd say

[Chorus]
The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad
If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your lover, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect, when the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your lover, and I'll hold your hand

She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
But now she's got a cup with something else in it
It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain

Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain

She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young, I was too young
Too young, too young, too young, young

[Verse 2]
And if she ever goes back to the water fountain
The handle will be broken and the rust set in
But my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it
My heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it
Now I'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And I know that it's only a wish
And that we're not standing by the water fountain
Too young, too young, too young, young

[Chorus]
She couldn't be at home in the night time
Because it made her feel alone
But at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young, I was too young
Too young, too young, too young, young

[Outro]
(Too young) I should've built a home with a fountain for us
(Too young) The moment that she told me that she was in love

The devil doesn't bargain

It's useless, don't do this, it's hubris to try

He's abusive, elusive, the truth is he lies

You can change him, but I know you won't

If I Killed Someone For You,Narrated For You,11/16/18,3:05,68,Alec Benjamin,Alec Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry that I did this
The blood is on my hands
I stare at my reflection
I don't know who I am
Practice my confession
In case I take the stand
I'll say I learned my lesson
I'll be a better man
I'm packing up my things and
I'm wiping down the walls
I'm rinsing off my clothes and
I'm walking through the halls
I did it all for her
So I felt nothing at all
I don't know what she'll say
So I'll ask her when she calls

[Chorus]
Would you love me more (Would you love me more)
If I killed someone for you?
Would you hold my hand (Would you hold my hand)
They're the same ones that I used
When I killed someone for you
Would you turn me in (Would you turn me in)
When they say I'm on the loose?
Would you hide me when (Would you hide me when)
My face is on the news?
'Cause I killed someone for you
I hear the sirens coming
I see the flashing lights
I'm driving through the suburbs
Wearing my disguise
I show up at her doorstep
To look her in the eyes
I tell her that it's me
But she doesn't recognize
Can't you see I'm running?
Said I need a place to hide
I've gotta ask you something
Could you please let me inside?
Just let me explain
No I wouldn't tell you lies
I know you'll understand
If you let me stay the night

[Chorus]
Would you love me more (Would you love me more)
If I killed someone for you?
Would you hold my hand (Would you hold my hand)
They're the same ones that I used
When I killed someone for you
Would you turn me in (Would you turn me in)
When they say I'm on the loose?
Would you hide me when (Would you hide me when)
My face is on the news?
'Cause I killed someone for you
[Bridge]
You have to understand that
The one I killed is me
Changing what I was
For what you wanted me to be
I followed your direction
Did everything you asked
I hope it makes you happy
'Cause there's just no turning back

Would you love me more (Would you love me more)

Boy In The Bubble,Narrated For You,11/16/18,3:01,66,Alec Benjamin,Alec Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
It was 6:48, I was walking home
Stepped through the gate, and I'm all alone
I had chicken on the plate, but the food was cold
Then I covered up my face so that no one knows
I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble
When my mom walked into the living room
She said, ""Boy, you gotta tell me what they did to you""
I said, ""You don't wanna know the things I had to do""
She said, ""Son, you gotta tell me why you're black and blue""
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
And my heart was pumping, chest was screaming
Mind was running, air was freezing
Put my hands up, put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight

[Chorus]
Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer
Well, I squared him up, left my chest exposed
He threw a quick left hook and it broke my nose
I had thick red blood running down my clothes
And a sick, sick look 'cause I like it though
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
And my heart was pumping, chest was screaming
Mind was running, nose was bleeding
Put my hands up, put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight

[Chorus]
Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer

[Verse 3]
It was 6:48, he was walking home
With the blood on his hands from my broken nose
But like every other day, he was scared to go
Back to his house 'cause his pops was home
Drowning his troubles in whiskey bubbles
Just looking for trouble
Well, there's no excuse for the things he did
But there's a lot at home that he's dealing with
Because his dad's been drunk since he was a kid
And I hope one day that he'll say to him
""Put down those bubbles and that belt buckle
In this broken bubble""
[Chorus]
Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down

And you get to my door, and you can't even speak

And you'll be my favorite mistake
I wish you could hold me, here shakin'
You're the risk, I'm gonna take it
Why aren't you here in my bedroom?
Hopelessly boring without you
Too soon to tell you ""I love you""
Too soon to tell you ""I love you""

Think I really want this

No, I'm actually invested

I cut the rope and you fell from the tower
I let it go for my peace of mind
Bit the bullet, it didn't hurt
But I still hate the image of you kissing her
I chalk it up to ""it's all for the better""

And I bet you're at her place right now
You're taking off your shoes, she's lying down

Tell me, is she prettier than she was on the internet?
Are your conversations cool? Like, are you even interested?
I know what you arе, brighter than the stars
Tell mе if she takes you far
Far enough away from all the baggage you've been carrying
Up another hill to all the girls who'll help you bury it
They're just blowing smoke
I'll say what they won't
I know everything they don't

I hear your voice like a boom in my tower
I sleep alone, I'm completely fine (Mm)

At the time, they fed the fantasy
I was so impressed at your hotel
Took a drag and read aloud to me

It was your one perfect opening

When you should be sleeping

Tough Love,The Secret of Us,6/21/24,2:49,74,Gracie Abrams,Gracie Abrams,"[Verse 1]
I took a train to Boston and I wanted to cry
He's gone, I'm twenty-four, and it's a Saturday night
I ran and took his jacket with the rip in the side
I hate when we fight, sucks when we fight
But, honestly, whatever, he's just one of the boys
I'll date for like a summer and I'll leave when I'm bored
This train is full of strangers but I might like 'em more
Said I might like 'em more, yeah, no, I like 'em more

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's just tough love
But I mean it, really mean it
I'm not charmed so I'm leavin'

[Chorus]
I laughed the second he tried to call my bluff
I guess it's always funny until it's not
When I left him there to feel it
Couldn't guess what I'd be leavin' for
No chance I waste my twenties on random men
Not one of them is cooler than all my friends
And I hate to leave him bleedin'
But I know now what I'm leavin' for

[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' by the river and I stop by the boats
At night it's kinda tempting just to see if you'd float
The benches by the Charles gave me somewhere to go
I feel like I'm home, there's a bar down the road
I'm wasted with the sister of a boy that I met
Through someone back in college, she's a weird intellect
She liked to tell the truth and she was harsh but direct
Her boyfriends all left, she had that effect
But that's just tough love
And you're lucky to receive it, right?
He'll crumble to pieces

I laughed the second he tried to call my bluff
I guess it's always funny until it's not
When I left him there in pieces
Couldn't guess what I'd be leavin' for

Tried to work it out through anxious pacin'

Worth the time and breath I know you're savin'?
But it's a lot

You openly admit you're far away from healing
And I hate to pull the plug, but I think I get your deal
I finally know better than to wait for you back here

[Chorus]
And I hope you know I don't think
You're a bad guy, that you're damaged
Took you two months, only two to raise the bar
You're the saddest, but a good kid
Almost loved you, but I didn't

I know that you're removed, I can feel it when we talk
You start to let me in, but then you shut it off
And it's half of you that hurts sometimes, the half that I don't get
I swear that I'm not mad at you, but I can't share your bed now

[Chorus]
And I can imagine, when you go home
Does she follow like an echo?
Like your shadow, you can try, but you can't run
From the truth of what you both made
That she blew up on a Tuesday
How does pain taste when it melts into your tongue?
It's a pain that I caught you at a bad time
It's a shame that I memorized your outline
You were straight up with me, you were so kind
But I knew what you knew, honey, great minds
It was harsh 'cause I lost what I wanted
I was brave when I kissed you in London
We're collateral here, man, we got hit
Hope you find somewhere safe for your baggage
Every page that I wrote, you were on it
Feel you deep in my bones, you're the current
And I showed no restraint, it was something
I was scared of 'til you made me love it

If you find yourself out, if there is a right time
Chances are I'll be here, we could share a lifeline
If you feel like fallin', catch me on the way down

I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

Party In The U.S.A.,The Time Of Our Lives - International Version,1/1/09,3:22,80,Miley Cyrus,Miley Cyrus,"[Verse 1]
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""
Movin' my hips like, ""Yeah""
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?""
""She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""
Movin' my hips like, ""Yeah""
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

Feel like hopping on a flight (On a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)
Something stops me every time (Every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright (Hey, hey)

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah"" (N-n-n-noddin' my head)

Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only ""baby""
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees

I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time

Close your eyes

Tell me what it feel like

Oh yeah, yeah
Like the songs that your mama sang to you
And the way that it makes you tell the truth
If you come from where you come, then you were born tough

Ooh, ah (Even if her face don't stay together?)
Ooh, ah

[Verse 2]
If you want a little more confidence
Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah, it's common sense
All you need's a couple more condiments
And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments, ha-ha
It's such a waste
When little girls grow into their mother's face
But little girls are learning how to cut and paste
And pucker up their lips until they suffocate, ha-ha

[Pre-Chorus]
Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic, it's only some plastic
No one will love you if you're unattractive

[Chorus]
Oh, Mrs. Potato Head, tell me
Is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh, Mr. Potato Head, tell me
How did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?
Even if her face don't stay together?

Getting drunk with the blue caterpillar

Tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed

[Verso 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Yo nunca pensé que pudiera querer
Con esta pasión que me quema la piel
Volar por tu cuerpo es el cielo tocar
Quiero contigo llegar

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Necеsito más de lo que me das
Todo ya no еs suficiente
Me deje llevar por un beso más
Yo estoy presa para siempre
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
Una noche más, oh
Quisiera inventar nuestro amor
Una noche más, oh-oh
Sentir junto a ti la pasión
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms

Vivir de ilusiones fue igual que morir
En otras caricias no pude encontrar

There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me

That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need

If I Were a Boy,I AM...SASHA FIERCE - Platinum Edition,2008,4:09,67,Beyoncé,Beyoncé,"[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me

Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many
Makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby

To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna

Fall for you, never you, baby

You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again

I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgettin'
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

Mind

Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
I don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

[Bridge]
How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Oh)
It makes me that much wiser (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Ha, a fighter)
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

You thought I would forget, thought I, I remember (Oh)
'Cause I remember (Oh)
I remember
You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)
I remember (Oh-ooh)

No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

Then maybe...

When you're on the phone (Oh, yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh, you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies, say, ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, ha, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track (Yeah)
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house (Oh, you're stuck)

You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else (Somebody)

If I Could Turn Back Time,Heart Of Stone,1/1/89,3:59,69,Cher,Cher,"[Intro]
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time

[Verse 2]
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything, darlin', then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind and darlin'

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do

[Bridge]
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
Oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
And maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
If I could reach the stars",,,,
Strong Enough,Believe,1998,3:44,66,Cher,Cher,"[Verse 1]
I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it? Was she worth it?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

[Verse 2]
So you feel misunderstood
Baby, have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go

Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true

Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough

Well, here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when
Your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

[Chorus]
After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me, after all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh, and on the way it grows
But it never disappears
After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you

In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy, won't you look down over me?
Yeah, I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a girl can be

Saw the ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security, they did not see him
They just hovered around his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
Down in the Jungle Room

I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

They've got gospel in the air (Ah)
And Reverend Green will be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy, you've got a prayer in Memphis
Now Gabriel plays piano every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see him
And they asked me if I would do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And he said ""Tell me, are you a Christian, child?""
And I said ""Man, I am tonight!""

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums, and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar...

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry...

[Chorus 1]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando...
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose

Dejó tejido su hilo dentro de mí

Y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos
Para escapar los dos volando un rato

Pero olvidaste una final instrucción
Porque aún no sé cómo vivir sin tu amor
Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa
Me enseñaste a decir mentiras piadosas
Para poder verte a horas no adecuadas

Y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones
Y conocí más de mil formas de besar

Juego mal hasta el parqués y jamás uso reloj
Y, para ser más franca, nadie piensa en ti como lo hago yo
Aunque te dé lo mismo

[Verso 2]
Si es cuestión de confesar
Nunca duermo antes de diez
Ni me baño los domingos
La verdad es que también lloro una vez al mes
Sobre todo cuando hay frio

[Pre-Coro]
Conmigo nada es fácil, ya debes saber
Me conoces bien
Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido

[Coro]
El cielo está cansado ya de ver la lluvia caer
Y cada día que pasa es uno más parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte porque
Seguir amándote es inevitable
Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hay que hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo
Ya sabrás la situación
Aquí todo está peor
Pero al menos aún respiro

[Pre-Coro]
No tienes que decirlo, no vas a volver
Te conozco bien
Ya buscaré qué hacer conmigo

Cuando estás bien, te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre 'toy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tiene' ahí
Oye, baby, no seas mala (Oh, no)
No me dejes con la' gana'
Se escucha en la calle que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

[Pre-Coro: Shakira & Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así

Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo, un egoísta

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje

Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje

Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie
Como tú me tientas cuando tú te mueves
Esos movimientos sexys, siempre me entretienen
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé por qué me tienes en lista de espera
Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

[Puente: Shakira & Maluma]
Pa', pa' que te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido
Y como un loco sigo tras de ti, muriendo por ti
Dime qué hay pa' mí, bebé (¿Qué?)

Jones Beach, 1988
Come on

[Verse 1]
Do you remember or should I rewind
To that summer when you caught my eye?
I played it cool, the weather was hot
You had the beauty and the beach on lock
With your flip flops, half shirt
Short shorts, mini skirt
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty
You wasn't lookin' for a man
When you saw me in the sand
But you fell for the boy from the city

[Pre-Chorus]
I was like
""Hey, girl, can I get your number?""
I remember what you told me too
""Don't call after 10:00"", but you know that I did
'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime
Do you remember? I'll never forget
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet
The water was cool, the feelin' was hot
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked
In your strapless sundress
Kickin' back, no stress
As long as we was together
'Cause we were feelin' young love
And we couldn't get enough
Baby, I could reminisce forever

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now I'm like
Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it?
And I wonder if you miss it too
Never thought it would end 'til it did
Now I'm here, and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime

(Break it down)
Summer ended, winter started
It got colder when we parted ways
(I like this part)
As the seasons change
(Now bring it, bring it back)
Winter melted, spring, I felt it
Summertime will never be the same
Without you (My summertime)
My summertime

Maybe I'm chasing a feeling
Maybe I don't even need it

I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you

I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight

Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I'll be out spendin' all this money while you're sittin' 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for

Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you (Yeah)

And if they're calling you away
I have no right to make you stay

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know the heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong to me

Sometimes goodbyes are not forever
It doesn't matter if you're gone
I still believe in us together
I understand more than you think I can
You have to go out on your own
So you can find your way back home

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry & All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage

I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (Oh-oh-oh)

Broken heart, you took two thirds
Guess that makes me the loser, huh?
Zero mileage
Brand-new speakers, driving
Still I sit in silence
Thinking about you
I miss driving in the HOV
Just you and me, no hurry
I miss dinners that we wouldn't eat
'Cause it wasn't cheap, no worries
I miss all the little things that we did, but didn't notice
You never know a good thing until it's gone
I miss driving in the HOV
Now life moves somewhat slowly

[Verse 2: Nic D]
I remember the day I said, I loved you and you said it back
Guess you happy now, how could I be upset with that?
Go from talking every day to no message back
How we go from letting me pay to a separate tab?
You even met my parents
Before you flew the coup
You made me think of marriage
Just like the movies do
My momma said I had a good one
My pops said it too
I told them 'bout the one that got away
But never told them it was you, you, you
All that time, yeah, it was you, you, you

[Chorus: 100graham]
I miss driving in the HOV
Just you and me, no hurry
I miss dinners that we wouldn't eat

I Dreamed a Dream,I Dreamed A Dream,11/20/09,3:10,50,Susan Boyle,Susan Boyle,"[Verse 1]
I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I prayed that God would be forgiving

[Verse 2]
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

[Bridge]
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
And they turn your dreams to shame

[Verse 3]
Still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

[Verse 4]
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed",operatic pop,,,

I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's a destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The likes of me abide

Always staying low

If it makes you feel sad
And I understand

Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone

Every streetlamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

[Verse 2]
Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression, and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound, some were hell-bound, some, they fell down
And some got back up and fought back against the meltdown
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked

The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green

Anything that it would tell me, that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win

And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you

That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So, little snowbird, take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow

How many times do I have to say
To get away, get gone?
Flip your shit past another lass's

You got your game, made your shot
And you got away with a lot

So put away that meat you're selling

And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting

If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting

How many times can it escalate
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?

That I'm much obliged to up and go
I'll idealize, then realize
That it's no sacrifice because the price is paid
And there's nothing left to grieve
Fuckin' go

And I do know what's good for me

Your hungry flirt borders intrusion
And I'm building memories
On things we have not said

Boy number one made a picnic for two
Saw he was nervous, I thought it was cute
Until I found out that his mom made the food
It was good though

His wife really had some impeccable taste
She was sweet though

That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that

But it's all coming back to me

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that

And it's all coming back to me

But it's all coming back to me now

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever (Forever)
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me

[Intro]
Royce

[Verso 1]
Y ya me contaron
Que te acomplejas de tu imagen
Y mira el espejo
Qué linda eres sin maquillaje

[Pre-Coro]
Y si eres gorda o flaca
Todo eso no me importa a mí
Y tampoco soy perfecto
Sólo sé que yo te quiero así

[Coro]
Y el corazón no tiene cara
Y te prometo que lo nuestro nunca va a terminar
Y el amor vive en el alma
Ni con deseos sabes que nada de ti va a cambiar

[Verso 2]
Prende una vela, rézale a Dios
Y dale gracias que tenemos ese lindo corazón
Prende una vela, pide perdón
Y por creer que tú eres fea te dedico esta canción
Si eres gorda o flaca
Todo eso no me importa a mí
Y tampoco soy perfecto
Sólo sé que yo te quiero así, oh

[Interludio]
Ladies, haha, you already know
Royce

Nadie es perfecto en el amor (En el amor)
Ay, seas blanquita o morenita, no me importa el color
Mírame a mí (Mírame a mí), mírame bien (Mírame bien)
Aunque tenga cara de bonito me acomplejo yo también

Todo eso no me importa a mí
Tampoco soy perfecto

Sentimiento, come on

[Verso 1]
Voy manejando por la noche y pienso en ti
Y en tantas cosas que no te llegué a decir
Y la luna desde lejos me acompaña
Y me trae tantos recuerdos que perdí
Y la radio esta tocando tu canción
La que bailamos tantas veces tú y yo
Y la lluvia cae tan fuerte en mi ventana
Y se evapora como gotas de tu amor
Y las luces de los autos brillan como las estrellas en el cielo del dolor
El camino va pasando y yo voy acelerando como quien busca el amor
Yo te busco como un loco

[Estribillo]
Dime
¿Dónde estarás?
¿Dónde estarás?
¿Todavía piensas en mí?
¿Dónde estarás?
¿Dónde estarás?
Yo sigo pensando en ti
Quiero saber si todavía te quedará un poquito de amor por mí
La carretera se hace larga y yo siento que puedo morir
Voy manejando, creo que va salir el sol
Qué diera yo por estar en tu habitación
Tu contestador responde mi llamada
Dejo grabado un mensaje con mi voz
Y te digo que te extraño, que eres tú toda mi vida, que me ahogo el alcohol
Que no acepto que termine, esta historia tan bonita, esta historia de los dos
Que ese tipo que pretende secuestrarme tus caricias no va ser mejor que yo
No lo dudes
Mi amor

Dime
¿Dónde estarás?

Amarte como te amo es complicado
Pensar como te pienso es un pecado
Mirar como te miro está prohibido
Tocarte como quiero es un delito (Uh)

[Pre-Coro]
Ya no sé qué hacer
Para que estés bien
Si apagar el sol para encender tu amanecer
Falar en portugués, aprender a hablar francés
O bajar la luna hasta tus pies

[Coro]
Yo solo quiero darte un beso
Y regalarte mis mañanas
Cantar para calmar tus miedos
Quiero que no te falte nada
Yo solo quiero darte un beso
Llenarte con mi amor el alma
Llevarte a conocer el cielo
Quiero que no te falte nada

Yeah

Hasta mi religión la cambiaría
Por ti hay tantas cosas que yo haría
Pero tú no me das ni las noticias (Uh)

[Verso 1]
Anoche soñé yo contigo del amor que perdimos
Del amor que tanto he sufrido y ahora estoy perdido
Tú me decías que me amabas, pero en mi espalda tú me engañabas
Por eso es que nuestro amor ha fracasado
Tal vez no sabes cuánto te amé, pero siempre lloré
Aunque tú nunca mi amor no hay notado
Tus labios me decían ""te amo"" y tus ojos me rechazaban
Por eso es que hoy, yo, mujer, ya no te creo

Yo te amé, te adoré
No te quiero ver
Y sufrí hasta el fin
No te quiero ver
Yo te amé, te adoré

[Verso 2]
Duramos una noche amando y la otra peleando
Y aunque todo seguía igual, pasaban los años
A pesar de tus engaños, tú me diste un milagro
Ese fruto de tu vientre que yo más amo

Hello,25,11/20/15,4:55,71,Adele,Adele,"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if, after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

Missing out the cracks in the pavement

What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?

Where is the love?

Where is the love? (The love)

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under

A wise man said, ""Follow the stars
There you shall find a piece of advice""
If you hate your enemies, enemies shine
If you're not a friend of me, entеr the light
'Cause you can nevеr kill my vibe
Got here with no sacrifices
Everything once taken, still have to make it
Vibe killer, me I no go take shit (Ayy)
Vibe killer, bloody Samaritan
Protect my energy from your bad aura
Na my pastor say I be my healer
Everything I desire, I go receive

My blessings tall like towers (Towers)
I posses a superpower (Power)
I let the good rain down like showers (Showers)
I never let them make me sour
'Cause it ain't that deep when they're shallow
They show you love but be hatin' in the shadows
Too many comparisons, I'm a Samaritan
Wanna shoot me down, no ammo
I'm who I am, I don't know about you
Tell no lies 'cause I live my truth
Lord knows I try doin' what I do
Every time that I talk, it's a business move
How about it? ('Bout it)
Don't you know that I'm about it ('Bout it)
So serious, ain't no clown shit
Meticulous, on my crown shit
Spiritually, physically fit, fit
See it from the flickin' of the hip (Hip)
Ayra and Ms. Kelly on a hit (Hit)
Only ring his celly when I'm lit
Girl, we be tellin' them, all my feminine melanin, represent
Gotta give the glory to Most High

He was always such a nice boy
The quiet one, with good intentions
He was down for his brother, respectful to his mother
A good boy
But good don't get attention
One kid with a promise
The brightest kid in school, he's not a fool
Readin' books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
'Cause smart don't make you cool, whoa

Well, he's not invisible anymore
With his Father's nine and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over prime-time news

[Chorus]
Mary's got the same size hands as Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theater Show
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole, oh
Now we'll never know
(No, no, no, no, stole, stole, oh)
They were cryin' to the camera, said he never fitted in
He wasn't welcome
He showed up to the parties we was hangin' in
Some guys were puttin' him down, bullyin' him 'round, round
Now I wish I would've talked to him
Gave him the time of day and not turned away
If I would’ve been the one to maybe go this far
He might've stayed at home
Playin' angry chords on his guitar

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, he's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name

She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure
It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems

Why don't I feel her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all
The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help

Release the pain

Snowbird,This Way Is My Way,1/1/98,2:14,51,Anne Murray,Anne Murray,"[Verse 1]
Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring

[Verse 2]
When I was young my heart was young then, too
Anything that it would tell me, that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win

[Chorus]
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you

[Verse 3]
The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So, little snowbird, take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you",pop,,,

Said, I gotta be the man, I'm the head of my band
Mic check, one, two
Shut 'em down in the club, what a playboy does
And they all get loose, loose off the bottle
We all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break rules 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down, a hundred super models

Stays right here, pri-private show

Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test

I can handle my shit

But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""

And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city

Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed his name
Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?

I stepped back from the game to keep you out of harm's way
Risk it all for the game but it take more than one person
Two people one 'til I feel the same when you hurtin'
I was still in middle school when Givens fled the whip
Bodies were droppin' before we ever knew 'bout the truck
We gonna be family no matter what way this go, brother
From the ugly corner where everybody betray each other
I let you hang in the jets, I let you bang with my set
Put you before my own flesh like why’d I ever do that?

Lost my dawg, got him back
Took him in, we shakin' back
Struggle never broke us, it just made us who we is
Losses taught a lot of lessons
Made the wins feelin' like blessings
Family all that you got at the end
Hope you get the message
I ain't tryin' to make it without you
But if I got to then I got you
This ain't about me, it's about the whole cake
We can take a slice on a different day
Just keep your plate
God, family, hustle, goals
Heart, mind, body, soul
Watching out for street signs on a narrow road
Heaven at the end, prayin' for the lost souls with my angels

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

Until I left the party the other night
Do you remember all the things that you said to me?
That came out of his mouth automatically

""I'm fine""
And then something that you did to hurt me worse, it comes to me
Despite (Those times)
One day I just wanna hear you say
""I like you""

What's stopping you? (Hey)
Ah, what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?

I lie here thinking 'bout every bad mistake I've made
